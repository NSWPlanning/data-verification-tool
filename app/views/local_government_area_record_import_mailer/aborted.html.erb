      Hi <%= @user.name %>
    </p>
    <p>
      Your import of '<%= @filename %>' was aborted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first 1000 items were all invalid, so we've aborted the import for you. This suggests that something fundamental is wrong with the file. Common reasons we've seen include:      
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>No zone information: LEP_SI_zone is blank.</li>
      <li>You're using a separate zone file (EHC_lganame_LEP_yyyymmdd.csv), but have not uploaded it first.</li>
      <li>dp_plan_label is not in the correct format - it should be "DP1234" or "DP 1234". "1234" will cause errors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Records in file: <%= @importer.valid_file_rows %>
    </p>
    <p>
      The errors seen in the first thousand records include:
      <table>
        <tr><th>Invalid Record Details</th></tr>
        <% @unique_exceptions.each do |message| %>
          <tr><td><%= message.to_s %></td></th>
        <% end %>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheers,
