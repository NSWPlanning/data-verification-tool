Hi <%= @user.name %>

Your import of '<%= @filename %>' was aborted.

The first 1000 items were all invalid, so we've aborted the import for you. This suggests that something fundamental is wrong with the file. Common reasons we've seen include:      

- No zone information: LEP_SI_zone is blank.
- You're using a separate zone file (EHC_lganame_LEP_yyyymmdd.csv), but have not uploaded it first.
- dp_plan_label is not in the correct format - it should be "DP1234" or "DP 1234". "1234" will cause errors.

Records in file: <%= @importer.valid_file_rows %>

The errors seen in the first thousand records include:
<% @unique_exceptions.each do |message| %>
- <%= message.to_s %>
<% end %>

Cheers,
